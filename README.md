# Reminders Server

This is the email server corresponding to the [Airtable Reminders Block](https://github.com/shaun3141/airremind)

This "email server" leverages Sendgrid to send out reminder emails. The business logic is in `server/app.js` 

Candidly, for this portion of the project, I had borrowed an existing boilerplate I had made for another project, SnoozeBot. 

The `web` and `client` folders can effectively be ignored.
